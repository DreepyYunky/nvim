## My personal Neovim confguration

This is my personal Neovi configuration which I maintain for 2 reasons:
- So if anything was to happen to my PC or user, I'll have something to continue from. The reason I started this was because I lost my old config based on kickstart.

- So, anyone can use this as a template.
